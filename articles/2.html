          Software development is more than just writing code that "works". It is a creative process that requires careful design. Good software design is what separates great developers from average ones. Just as music composers carefully orchestrate the notes and rhythms of a symphony, software developers must carefully orchestrate the modules and interactions of a software system. Both composers and developers must consider the overall structure of their work, as well as the individual elements that make it up. The goal is to create something that is both functional and elegant.

            Why software design matters
          </h2><br>
          <p class="section-text">           
            <span class="headline">Cost savings</span><br>
            Well-designed software is easier to maintain and extend, which can save you time and money in the long run.
            <br><br>
            <span class="headline">Faster development</span><br> 
            Good software design can help you to develop your software more quickly by making it easier to reuse code and by reducing the number of bugs.
            <br><br>
            <span class="headline">Better Quality</span><br> 
            Well-designed code is a joy to work with. It's easy to understand and change, which means fewer bugs and better software overall.
          </p>
          <h2 class="headline">
            The philosophy of good software design
          </h2><br>
          <p class="section-text">
            <span class="headline">Modularity</span><br>
            As a software evolves in functionality, its complexity grows. Good design aims to manage this complexity by making self-contained modules. This makes the software simpler to modify.
            <br><br>
            <span class="headline">Abstraction</span><br> 
            Big systems with too many small parts are difficult to comprehend. As software development is a continuous process, the codebase can end up with too many components. Grouping these components according to their functionality and abstracting away the complex components can go a long way in reducing complexity. Besides, this design refactoring results in elegant and efficient code.
            <br><br>
            <span class="headline">Unambiguity</span><br> 
            The goal of software design is to create "obvious" code that one can understand and modify. Easy changes should be obvious to make and there should be one obvious way to do it. A developer working with unambigious code feels confident after making changes to support a feature.
          </p>
          <h2 class="headline">
            Techniques for good design
          </h2><br>
          <p class="section-text">  
            Using design patterns, following coding standards and getting feedback from other developers can help in improving software design. While these are good to start with, you can develop your own techniques with inspiration from popular frameworks. For instance, the Python data science libraries, The C++ Standard Template Library and the Unix file IO API are excellent examples of good design.         
          </p>

          <h2 class="headline">
            The future of good software design
          </h2><br>
          <p class="section-text">  
            The rise of AI, cloud computing, microservices and the growing concerns for privacy would shape the future of software design. However, the basic philosophy of software would remain the same to create unambiguous systems.
            <br><br>
            The future of good software design is bright. As software becomes more complex and interconnected, the need for good software design will only grow. Software designers who are able to adapt to the changing landscape will be in high demand.
