          I've been a big fan of Wordle since it first came out. I was addicted to it for a while, but I found that there were too many words to guess from. I wanted a challenge that was more focused, so I created a command line version of Wordle called VERBLE. Yes, I'm very imaginative like that.

          How to play
        </h2><br> 
        The rules of Verble are simple.   <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>You have six attempts to guess a five-letter verb. After each guess, the letters are marked as either green, yellow, or red.</li>
          <li>Green means that the letter is correct and in the correct position.</li>
          <li>Yellow means that the letter is in the answer, but not in the correct position.</li>
          <li>Red means that the letter is not in the answer at all.</li>
        </ul>

          Implementation

        The hunt for a list of verbs
        </h3><br>
        At the heart of any word game, you'll find, unsurprisingly, a trusty list of words. So, I went on a little adventure through the vast realm of Internet to find the perfect verb list. I struck gold and decided to use Ashley Bovan's verb list. 
        <br><br>
        However, this list has verbs of various lengths - so, I wrote a script to trim it to only 5 letter verbs. Since it is almost never fun to guess obscure verbs, I also removed many obscure verbs referencing Google's N-gram Corpus.            
        <br><br><h3 class="headline">
          The plan
          </h3><br>
          <ul>
            <li>The main game loop picks random word from the list, interacts with user and calls "validator" on every user word input</li>
            <li>The validator compares input with the picked word , counts number of matched letters and creates a list of 3-state boolean values for each letter - </li>
            
              <li>If the letter matches, "True" , else, "None". Now, the "None" letters are set to "False" only if the count of matched letters is less than the number of instances of that letter in the word. </li>

            <li>This is also used to decide the color of each letter</li>
            <li>A helpful hinter can reveal 2 letters either at once or in two instances - This makes the game little more fun.</li>
          </ul>
        <br><br><h3 class="headline">
        The choice of UI
        </h3><br>
        Since I decided to implement the game in command line, I decided that color needs to be handled so that the game works well across platforms. I started implementation with "Colorama" and then found that "Blessed" does a better job of what I need - so, that's what I ended up using.
        <br><br><h3 class="headline">
         Deployment
        </h3><br>
        I had never deployed a Python console application before. So, I looked up how to do that and learnt about PyInstaller. They make the process quite easy - pass the executable name and folder path to the command line tool and you are done. Now, the final part of deployment is to automate this whenever I update the source code. This is where I learnt of GitHub actions. It is, in a similar vein, simple to do - create YAML file with steps and add this to repo.
        <br><br><h2 class="headline">
        To sum it up
        </h2><br>
        Verble was a fun game to implement. Verble's logic fell into place like pieces of a puzzle and the deployment in particular was a great learning experience.
